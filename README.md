This is a basic film reciprocity calculator. I was tired of looking up the same reciprocity charts (if the company even has them; looking at you, Kodak).

I couldn't find a simple to use free one online, so I built one.

It uses measured time because I like my light meter, and I hate figuring out stop adjustments.

Currently has these film options:
	- Portra 400 and 160
		- Taken from this forum: https://www.flickr.com/groups/477426@N23/discuss/72157635197694957/

	- Velvia
	- Ektar 100
		- Both taken from this blog: https://www.jasonrobertjones.com/journal/2018/2/5/velvia-reciprocity-chart

Message or email me to add film if you ever find this (how did you find this, you freak?), or just make a pull request. The JSON is not complicated.
